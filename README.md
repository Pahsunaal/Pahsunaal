- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Timothy Mitcheson - otherwise known (or more likely unknown) as Pahsunaal.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game design and development, as well as board and tabletop games such as Dungeons and Dragons.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Java, GML, and pixelart. Oh, and I'm studying for a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Warwick.
