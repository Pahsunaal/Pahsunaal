- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Timothy Mitcheson (Pahsunaal)!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game design and development, as well as board and tabletop games such as Dungeons and Dragons.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Java, GML, and pixelart. Oh, and I'm studying for a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Warwick.

My current project is Shifting Sands, a puzzle platformer with time-travel elements, a linear story, and boolean algebra! My profile picture is a sample of the art for the main character, Kai.
